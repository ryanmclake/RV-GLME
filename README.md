# RV-GLME
Resoving Variability of Global Lake Methane Emissions

# Things MEL thinks should be included in this file (which I'm sure you were planning to include anyways)

1. Give the reviewer step-by-step directions to help them run the code, including what version of R needs to be used and any tips about package installation. 

2. Summarize the purpose of each workflow script at a high level, being sure to note any discrepancies that you expect due to the fact that the repo is only working with Belgium data as an example rather than the whole globe (i.e., the parameter values I got when I fitted models weren't always exactly the same as what was listed in your prediction functions, but I assume that's because I was just using a subset of the data)

3. Links to relevant resources - for example, does the GLCP have a website that people can look at?

Overall I think this looks really good!!
